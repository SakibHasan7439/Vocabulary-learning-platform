ü•áü•á **My Journey Through This Project**
        This project was a special one for me, it was up to my designing knowledge that how will be the website will look, because we didn't got any figma or pdf file to use . So I had to use my design sense perfectly.
        Also I've used the authentication system in my project which is one of the most important thing for a website to be secure. Overall it wasn't smooth I really got stuck at some point, and had been sitting in my the desk for hours but successfully fixed those issues. I've successfully able to apply my knowledge in this project I'm sure this project will help me in my Development journey and boost my mental strength to learn more about it .
